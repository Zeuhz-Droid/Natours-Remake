when talking about em and rems, 
rems is in relation to the root font size, while ems is in relation to the parents' font size
 
For ems; when dealing with fontsize --it is in relation to the parent,
but when dealing with lengths --it is in relation to the current or the initial font-size
NOTE: percentages are relative to the parent's font-size, when used to measure font-size
percentages are relative to the parent's width, when used to measure length
